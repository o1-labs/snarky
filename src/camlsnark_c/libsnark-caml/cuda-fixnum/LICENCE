(a) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE, THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT SOFTWARE, OR

IN THIS CLAUSE, CSIRO INCLUDES ANY THIRD PARTY AUTHOR OR OWNER OF ANY PART OF
THE SOFTWARE OR MATERIAL DISTRIBUTED WITH IT. CSIRO MAY ENFORCE ANY RIGHTS ON
BEHALF OF THE RELEVANT THIRD PARTY.

If you intend to access the Software in connection with your employment or as an
agent for a principal, you should only accept this agreement if you have been
authorised to do so by your employer or principal (as applicable). By accepting
this agreement, you are warranting to CSIRO that you are authorised to do so on
behalf of your employer or principal (as applicable).

The Software may contain third party material obtained by CSIRO under licence.
Your rights to such material as part of the Software under this agreement is
subject to any separate licence terms identified by CSIRO as part of the
Software release - including as part of the Supplementary Licence, or as a
separate file. Those third party licence terms may require you to download the
relevant software from a third party site, or may mean that the third party
licensor (and not CSIRO) grants you a licence directly for those components of
the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the necessary
rights to such third party material.
