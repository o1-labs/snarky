   We refer below to this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/426.pdf.

I arrived at this value for the number of rounds in the following way.
As mentioned on page 34, the cost of performing the Grobner basis attack is estimated as

( (n + d) choose d ) ^ omega
where 

- omega is some number which is known to be >= 2
- n = 1 + m*N is the number of variables in the system of equations on page 3
- d is a quantity which they estimate as ((alpha - 1)(m*N + 1) + 1) / 2
- m is the state size, which we can choose
- N is the number of rounds which we can choose

In our case, `alpha = 11`, and I took `m = 3` which is optimal for binary Merkle trees.
Evaluating the above formula with these values and `N = 11` and `omega = 2` yields an attack complexity
of a little over 2^257, which if we take the same factor of 2 security margin as they use in the paper,
gives us a security level of 257/2 ~= 128.

NB: As you can see from the analysis this is really specialized to alpha = 11 and the number of rounds
should be higher for smaller alpha.
