(* Welcome!

   Snarky is a library for constructing R1CS SNARKs.

   TODO: Explanation of R1CSs, how it makes addition and scalar mult 'free' but
   multiplication of variables costs 1.

(* 1. There is a monad called 'Checked'. It has an extra type parameter but let's
  ignore that for now *)

let _foo () : (unit, _) Checked.t = Checked.return ()

(* The point of this monad is to describe "checked computations"
   which are computations that may "request" values from their environment,
   and make assertions about values that arise in the computation.

   You "run" Checked.t's in two ways:
   1. To generate a constraint system for the SNARK
   2. To generate proofs.

   We'll see exactly how this works later.

   First let's understand "field var"s which are the main primitive type we
   have access to in Checked.t's.
*)
(* A [Field.t] represents an element of the finite field of order [Field.size]
   It is a prime order field so you can think about it as "integers mod Field.size".

(* Try seeing what operations there are in the [Field] module by using
   your editor's auto-completion feature
*)
(* Inside Checked.t's we work with "Field.var"s. These are sort of like
   Field.t's but we can make assertions about them.

   Field.Checked provides "Checked" versions of the usual field operations.
*)
(* [assert_equal : Field.var -> Field.var -> (unit, _) Checked.t] lets us
   make an assertion that two field elements are equal.

   Here we assert that [x] is a square root of 9.

(* Exercise 1:
   Write a function
   [assert_is_cube_root_of_1 : Field.var -> (unit, _) Checked.t]
   that asserts its argument is a cube root of 1.

   Aside:
   In finite fields there may be either 1 or 3 cube roots of 1.
   This is because

   x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)

   so if [x^2 + x + 1] has a root in the field, then we will get
   another cube root of 1. By quadratic formula,

   x^2 + x + 1 = 0 iff
   x = ( -1 +/- sqrt (1 - 4) ) / 2

   so if sqrt(1 - 4) = sqrt(-3) exists in the field then there will
   be two additional cube roots of 1.

(* At this point, we have covered one way to pass data to a checked
   computation: describing what types the data has in our [Data_spec], and
   then passing the data into [prove]. This works perfectly well, but we have
   to hand the same data to the verifier before they can check our proof! To
   avoid handing over data that we want to keep 'secret', we need a different
   strategy.

   The most general way to do this is using the [exists] function. It takes a
   [Typ.t] argument, so that it knows how to translate the data, and two
   (optional) arguments
   * [~compute] passes a computation of type [('value, _) As_prover.t] which
     describes how to compute the value
   * [~request] passes a computation of type
     [('value Request.t, _) As_prover.t], which describes how to build a
     'request' for the a value of type ['value].

   For now, we will focus on the [~compute] argument.

   Rework your solution to exercise 5 to provide a proof that [sum] and
   [sum_unchecked] return the same value, but without exposing the

(* Now we can say that a value 'exists' without giving it away to the verifier,

   If we don't have all the information we need yet, we can build a Request for
   it instead, and use [exists ~request] to send it. New kinds of request can
   be made by extending the [Request.t] type.

   When we are ready to handle the request, we use the [handle] function.
   A handler looks like [fun (With {request; respond}) -> ...], where [request]
